# MWPLU Project Context (Index)

This is the top-level context for the MWPLU Vue 3 web application. The context is now split into focused documents:

- Architecture and Stack: see Architecture
- Routing and Navigation: see Routing
- State Management: see State
- Services and Integrations: see Services
- Analytics and Privacy: see Analytics & Privacy
- UI/Design System: see UI & Design
- Features Status: see Features Status
- Roadmap and Focus: see Roadmap & Focus

Documents

- Architecture: `.cursor/rules/architecture.mdc`
- Routing: `.cursor/rules/routing.mdc`
- State: `.cursor/rules/state.mdc`
- Services: `.cursor/rules/services.mdc`
- Analytics & Privacy: `.cursor/rules/analytics_privacy.mdc`
- UI & Design: `.cursor/rules/ui_design.mdc`
- Features Status: `.cursor/rules/features_status.mdc`
- Roadmap & Focus: `.cursor/rules/roadmap_focus.mdc`

Notes

- The app uses Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>`, Pinia, Vue Router, Supabase, and Firebase Analytics. Cloudflare Turnstile is integrated client-side; server validation endpoint is a placeholder.
- PLU document routes are slug-based and protected; selections are handled in `stores/plu.js` and navigated via `PluSelectionForm`.
